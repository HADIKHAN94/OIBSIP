# 🔌 Python Socket Client–Server Chat

This project demonstrates a simple **client–server communication system** using Python’s built‑in `socket` library. It showcases how two programs can exchange messages over TCP/IP, forming the foundation of real‑time networking applications.

## 📌 Features
- **Server Program**: Listens on a port, accepts client connections, and exchanges messages.
- **Client Program**: Connects to the server, sends user input, and displays server responses.
- **Interactive Chat**: Both sides can send and receive messages until the client types `bye`.
- **TCP/IP Communication**: Reliable connection using Python’s `socket` module.
